# GF-Edit-File-Upload
GF Edit File Upload is a Gravity Forms plugin which allows users to edit a file upload field for a specified entry. 

## Usage
Simply use the shortcode `[gfeditupload entryid=# fieldid=#]` to edit any file upload field.
Note that this plugin 'soft deletes': the file is not deleted from the folder but instead merely removed from the entry.
